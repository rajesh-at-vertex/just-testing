An eagle is a large and powerful bird of prey.
They are known for their sharp eyesight, strong beaks, and strong claws, which help them catch food.
Eagles usually hunt small animals like fish, rabbits, rats and squirrels.

Home
-----
Eagles make their homes in large nests called eyries.
Eagle nests are really big and strong

Baby
----
An eagle baby is called an eaglet.
When an eagle egg hatches, the eaglet is small, soft, and covered in fluffy down feathers.
It can't fly right away and relies on its parents to keep it warm and fed. The parents, usually both the mother and father, take turns feeding the eaglet by bringing food like fish or small animals to the nest.
