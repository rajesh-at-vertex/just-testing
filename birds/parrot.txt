A parrot is a colorful and fun bird that is famous for its ability to talk and mimic sounds.
They have bright feathers in many colors, like green, red, blue, and yellow.
Parrots have strong, curved beaks that help them crack open nuts and seeds, and they also have zippy feet that allow them to grab onto things, almost like hands!

A baby parrot is called a chick.
When a parrot chick is born, it is very small, blind, and has soft, fluffy feathers.
At first, it is completely dependent on its parents for warmth and food.
The parents feed the chick a special food called crop milk, which is a nutritious liquid that helps the chick grow quickly.
