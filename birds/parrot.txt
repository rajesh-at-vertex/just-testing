A parrot is a colorful and fun bird that is famous for its ability to talk and mimic sounds.
They have bright feathers in many colors, like green, red, blue, and yellow.
Parrots have strong, curved beaks that help them crack open nuts and seeds, and they also have zippy feet that allow them to grab onto things, almost like hands!
